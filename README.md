# Notes about Globle

**Version 1.6.0** - [Change log](CHANGELOG.md)

## Listed countries
- The list of countries for this game is the same as that used by [Sporcle](https://www.sporcle.com/blog/2013/01/what-is-a-country/)
- Some alternate spellings and previous names are accepted, e.g. Burma for Myanmar.
- France and UK have many territories scattered throughout the globe, and they confuse the proximity algorithm, so they are not highlighted when those countries are guessed.
- Geography can be a sensitive topic, and some countries' borders are disputed. If you believe a correction should be made, please politely raise an issue or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/theAbeTrain).

## Tip
If you are really struggling to find the answer, I recommend going to Google Maps or Earth. Better to learn about a new country than never get the answer!

## Attributions
- This game was inspired by Wordle and the "Secret Country" geography games from [Sporcle](https://sporcle.com)
- Country outlines in the Help screen provided by Vemaps.com
- Favicons are from favicon.io
